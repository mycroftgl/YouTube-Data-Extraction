This code was developed as a part of my Master's dissertation project, which involved scraping data from YouTUbe videos using the YouTube API.

I was working in the Google Colab environment as this allows the use of YouTube Data API v3, where some older environments do not.
Due to the size of data I was collecting, I have included features to assist in big data collection such as API Key rotating, which allows more API requests without paying for premium services.

This project is a good template for anyone looking to extract data ready for analysis for free, with minimal software installation or hardware requirements.
Ideal for someone with limited resources.
